# GitNode
GitNode is a small project I made using [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/) that takes a Node.js github repository and runs it within the client.
Gitnode only needs php to run, but you can run it with just html if you set the headers `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`.
